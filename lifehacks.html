<h2> The Importance of Budgeting </h2>
<p>
	So one of the big signs of being an adult is being financially responsible and independent. Wherever possible I believe it is important to stay out of debt, it is better to live within your means and save up than to spend what you don’t have, in the interest of instant gratification. One thing that will make this infinitely easier is budgeting and tracking your spending. I don&apos;t care if it is a cup of coffee, a Snickers bar or a damn paper clip; if you are paying for it you should strive to track it. This is because one small cup of coffee turns into several in a month and that adds up.
    <br><br/>
	I was quite surprised when I first started tracking my spending, I was often confused as to where all my money was going. I wasn&apos;t buying new clothes or shoes or even makeup, so where was my money going? Food. I was eating out more often than I thought and even the affordable student meal deals, much like my coffee habit, were adding up. The amount I was spending on eating out was about three quarters of what I was spending on groceries. Not only was this an expensive habit but it was also unhealthy. So I started budgeting and tracking my spending more regularly so I could be aware of my cash flow.

	So how do you go about doing this yourself, well I would recommend starting with an app to track your spending. In light of that you can move on to set a budget that suits your needs and lifestyle. Over the last couple years I have used a few apps to help me track my spending, I am currently using Spending, pictured bellow, mainly because it does everything I need it to and looks cute. You can create your own categories and can have multiple accounts present, e.g. Personal and Work etc.

	When you set your budget I tend to start by setting aside things that I absolutely need, so rent, utilities, and groceries. You should have an idea of how much you spend from your tracking as well as previous experience. Then you can move on to eating out, entertainment, clothing etc. This is of course not a science and you won’t always stick to it rigidly, but it does help. If you are lucky enough to be in a position to save then I highly recommend you set aside some money that you do not touch unless it is an emergency. This comes in handy when a laptop is damaged or if you loose your primary source of income at some point. Optimally the money you save could eventually contribute to a downpayment on a house some day.
